# olcGameEngine
A feature complete Game engine with a 3D graphics pipeline, audio, networking, and much more! Test game included!

## Building:
Currently, only Linux is supported. You can probably modify the CMake files to use

## Note: 
The game engine is still under heavy active development. Many features such as networking and the test game either don't work or are still in the early staages of development. Furthermore, bugs are unfortunately exepected.
